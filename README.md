Fraud probability for each potential customer and transaction

Fraud is one of the most significant issues the finance sector faces. It is incredibly costly. According to one study, it is estimated that the typical organization 
looses 5% of its annual revenue to fraud each year. When applied to the 2017 estimated Gross World Product of 79.6 trillion dollars, this translates to potential 
global losses of up to 4 trillion dollars.

Fraud detection is a task inherently suitable for machine learning, as machine learningâ€“based models can scan through huge transactional datasets, 
detect unusual activity, and identify all cases that might be prone to fraud. Also, the computations of these models are faster compared to traditional rule-based 
approaches. By collecting data from various sources and then mapping them to trigger points, machine learning solutions are able to discover the rate of defaulting 
or fraud propensity for each potential customer and transaction, providing key alerts and insights for the financial institutions.
