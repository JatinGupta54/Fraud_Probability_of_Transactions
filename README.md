# Fraud Probability Detection for Customers and Transactions

## Overview
Fraud remains one of the most critical challenges in the finance sector, resulting in substantial financial losses. Studies estimate that organizations lose approximately 5% of their annual revenue to fraud, which can translate into global losses of up to $4 trillion when applied to the 2017 Gross World Product of $79.6 trillion.

Detecting fraud is inherently suited for machine learning (ML) due to its ability to analyze extensive transactional datasets, identify unusual activities, and predict fraud more efficiently than traditional rule-based systems. This project leverages ML models to assess the fraud probability for each potential customer and transaction, offering key insights and alerts to financial institutions.

## Project Goals
#### Develop ML Models: Create and train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of fraud in transactions.
#### Data Integration: Collect and integrate data from various sources to improve the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection.
#### Performance Metrics: Evaluate model performance based on precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics.

## Features
Fraud Probability Scoring: Assess the probability of fraud for each transaction and customer.
Data Processing: Process and analyze large volumes of transactional data efficiently.
Alerts and Insights: Generate alerts for potential fraudulent activities and provide actionable insights.
